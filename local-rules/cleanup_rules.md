- Identify deprecated or unused code that can be safely removed
- Help detect and eliminate duplicate or redundant implementations
- Suggest refactoring opportunities to replace obsolete patterns or approaches

## Documentation Cleanup

- Find and remove outdated documentation that no longer reflects current functionality
- Identify redundant documentation that can be consolidated
- Help update or remove documentation for removed or changed features

## Old Code Detection
